## Rose API for NodeJS

This package provides the API client for RoseStudio, a
meta-programming environment focussing on Robotics applications.  The
RoseStudio website can be found at
[here](https://rose-studio.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com).

The list of API methods can be found [here](global.html).

### Purpose of the API

The Rose API enables the use of Rose features outside the RoseStudio website interface. It allows the developers to

- integrate Rose into their NodeJs code on source code basis, and/or
- use the command line interface to apply Rose's code-generation functionality on local files.

We don't want to explain the principles of Rose(-Studio) here in detail, please refer to [this document]() for further explanation.
